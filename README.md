Welcome to my kahoot bot! This is a bot that takes a user defined nickname and pin number (for entering the game) and creates a defined number of bots in a different Kahoot game. I would not recommend the use of this to annoy teachers, but you may do as you please. You may need to change some of the coordinates based upon the size of your monitor.

And tat's it!
